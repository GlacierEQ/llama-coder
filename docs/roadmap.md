# Llama Coder Roadmap

This document outlines our plans for future development of Llama Coder. Features and timelines may change based on community feedback and priorities.

## Short-term Goals (Next 3 Months)

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Implement streaming completions for faster response time
- [ ] Add intelligent caching system for frequently used completions
- [ ] Optimize context building for reduced latency
- [ ] Add support for GPU acceleration on more hardware configurations

### User Experience
- [ ] Create a model management UI within VS Code
- [ ] Improve inline suggestion UI with better visibility options
- [ ] Add customizable keybindings for all actions
- [ ] Implement auto-selection of appropriate models based on file type

### Core Features
- [ ] Support for multi-file context with smart pruning
- [ ] Implement project-specific configuration files
- [ ] Add language-specific prompt templates
- [ ] Create a debugging mode with detailed logs

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 Months)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Add support for chat-like interactions for explaining code
- [ ] Implement function signature auto-completion
- [ ] Create test generation capabilities
- [ ] Support for code refactoring suggestions
- [ ] Add documentation generation for functions and classes

### Integration
- [ ] Integrate with GitHub issues for context
- [ ] Add support for custom model endpoints beyond Ollama
- [ ] Create plugins for other IDEs (IntelliJ, Neovim)
- [ ] Implement optional telemetry for feature usage insights

### Models & Performance
- [ ] Support for fine-tuning models on your codebase
- [ ] Create model mixture capabilities (different models for different tasks)
- [ ] Add RAM-optimized models for low-spec machines
- [ ] Implement background model loading and switching

## Long-term Goals (6+ Months)

### AI-Assisted Development
- [ ] Complete function implementation generation
- [ ] Code review assistant capabilities
- [ ] Bug detection and automatic fixing
- [ ] Architecture suggestion features
- [ ] Support for generating entire components based on specifications

### Advanced Integration
- [ ] Integration with version control for smarter context

- [ ] CI/CD integration for model updates
- [ ] Project scaffolding capabilities
- [ ] API client code generation

### Research & Innovation
- [ ] Support for upcoming smaller, faster models
- [ ] Research into domain-specific fine-tuning
- [ ] Explore retrieval-augmented generation for large codebases
- [ ] Investigate multi-modal models for UI generation

## Community-Requested Features Under Consideration

We're evaluating the following features based on community interest:

- Voice-controlled coding assistance
- Natural language to code translation
- Automated code optimization suggestions
- Support for visual programming assistance (diagrams, flowcharts)
- Integration with package managers for context
- Project dependency analysis and suggestions
- Support for cloud-synced personal coding style profiles
- Multi-language translation of code comments and documentation
