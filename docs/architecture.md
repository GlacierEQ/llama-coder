# Llama Coder Architecture

This document explains how Llama Coder works internally, which may be useful for contributors or users who want to understand the system better.

## System Overview

Llama Coder consists of several components working together:

1. **VS Code Extension**: The UI layer that integrates with the editor
2. **Completion Engine**: Processes code and generates completions
3. **Context Manager**: Gathers relevant code context
4. **Ollama Client**: Communicates with the Ollama API
5. **Cache Manager**: Optimizes performance by caching results

## Component Breakdown

### VS Code Extension

The extension integrates with VS Code's IntelliSense system to provide code completions. It:

- Listens for typing events
- Displays inline suggestions
- Handles keyboard shortcuts
- Manages VS Code settings
- Provides status indicators

### Completion Engine

The completion engine is responsible for:

- Generating appropriate prompts from code context
- Processing completion requests
- Formatting responses
- Filtering inappropriate suggestions
- Ranking multiple completion options

### Context Manager

This component builds context for the language model by:

- Analyzing the current file
- Including relevant code from other open files
- Managing context window limitations
- Extracting relevant information from the workspace
- Prioritizing most relevant code segments

### Ollama Client

A lightweight client that:

- Communicates with the Ollama REST API
- Handles request/response formatting
- Manages connection errors and retries
- Implements streaming for faster initial results
- Controls request parameters (temperature, tokens, etc.)

### Cache Manager

Improves performance by:

- Storing frequent completions
- Implementing LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction
- Persisting cache between sessions
- Invalidating cache when files change
- Optimizing memory usage

## Request Flow

1. User types code in the editor
2. VS Code extension detects typing and requests completion
3. Context manager builds prompt with relevant code
4. Completion engine sends request to Ollama client
5. Ollama client checks cache, then queries Ollama API if needed
6. Model generates completion
7. Response is processed and formatted
8. Completion is displayed as suggestion in editor
9. User accepts or ignores the suggestion

## Performance Optimizations

- **Streaming responses**: Start displaying results as soon as they begin arriving
- **Caching**: Store frequent completions to avoid redundant requests
- **Context pruning**: Remove irrelevant code to maximize context window usage
- **Batched requests**: Group multiple completion requests when possible
- **Debouncing**: Wait for typing to pause before triggering completions
- **Parallel processing**: Handle multiple tasks concurrently when appropriate

## Security Considerations

- All code processing happens locally
- No data is sent to external servers
- Sensitive data remains on your machine
- Model files are verified via checksum upon download
- Optional telemetry is disabled by default
