# Fine-Tuning Models for Your Codebase

This guide walks through the process of fine-tuning language models to specialize them for your team's codebase, increasing the relevance and quality of code completions.

## Why Fine-Tune Models

Fine-tuning provides several benefits over using generic models:

- **Better understanding** of your project's specific patterns and conventions
- **More accurate completions** that match your team's coding style
- **Reduced hallucinations** when dealing with custom libraries and APIs
- **Improved handling** of domain-specific terminology
- **Higher acceptance rate** of suggested completions

## Prerequisites

Before starting the fine-tuning process:

1. **Gather hardware resources**:
   - High-end GPU (NVIDIA A100, A6000, or RTX 4090 recommended)
   - At least 32GB system RAM
   - 100GB+ available storage

2. **Install required software**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - PyTorch
   - Transformers library
   - Git
   - CUDA toolkit (for GPU acceleration)

3. **Prepare your environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv llama-tuning
   source llama-tuning/bin/activate  # On Windows: llama-tuning\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install requirements
   pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets accelerate peft trl
   ```

## Data Collection and Preparation

### 1. Collect Training Data

Gather high-quality code from your repositories:
