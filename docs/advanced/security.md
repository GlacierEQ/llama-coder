# Security Considerations

This document covers security best practices when using Llama Coder, particularly for production environments and sensitive codebases.

## Privacy Advantages of Local Inference

Llama Coder's primary security benefit is that your code never leaves your machine or your controlled environment:

- No code is sent to external servers
- No telemetry data is collected
- Complete control over your data
- Compliance with data-handling policies

## Security Best Practices

### Local Setup Security

1. **Keep Ollama Updated**
   - Regularly check for and apply updates to the Ollama software
   - Monitor the Ollama GitHub repository for security announcements

2. **Restrict Model Access**
   - Configure file system permissions to restrict who can access model files
   - Consider encrypting the disk where models are stored

3. **Monitor Resource Usage**
   - Set up alerts for unusual CPU/RAM/GPU usage
   - Use tools like `htop`, `nvidia-smi`, or Activity Monitor to watch for anomalies

4. **Verify Model Sources**
   - Only download models from trusted sources
   - Verify checksums when available

### Remote Setup Security

1. **Network Security**
   - Never expose Ollama directly to the internet without proper security
   - Use a VPN or SSH tunnel for remote connections
   - Set up TLS/SSL for all communications

2. **Authentication**
   - Always enable bearer token authentication:
     ```json
     {
       "llamaCoder.bearerToken": "your-secure-token"
     }
     ```
   - Use long, randomly generated tokens (min. 32 characters)
   - Rotate tokens periodically

3. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Restrict access to the Ollama port (11434) by IP address
   - Use `iptables`, `ufw` or cloud security groups to limit access:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 11434 proto tcp
     ```

4. **Reverse Proxy Setup**
   - Consider using Nginx or Caddy as a reverse proxy
   - Enable request rate limiting
   - Set up proper logging

## Securing Sensitive Code

1. **Configure Exclusions**
   - Exclude sensitive files/folders from being processed:
     ```json
     {
       "llamaCoder.exclude": [
         "**/*password*",
         "**/*secret*",
         "**/credentials/*"
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Restrict Context Collection**
   - Limit the amount of context Llama Coder can access:
     ```json
     {
       "llamaCoder.maxFileContextLines": 100,
       "llamaCoder.maxWorkspaceContextFiles": 5
     }
     ```

3. **Use Workspace Trust Features**
   - Leverage VS Code's workspace trust features
   - Configure Llama Coder to only run in trusted workspaces

## Container Deployment Security

When running Ollama in containers:

1. **Use Non-Root Users**
   - Run the container as a non-root user
   - Apply the principle of least privilege

2. **Container Isolation**
   - Use proper resource limits
   - Implement network isolation
   - Mount volumes as read-only when possible

3. **Scan Container Images**
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities
   - Use tools like Trivy or Clair

## Enterprise Deployment

For enterprise environments:

1. **Centralized Management**
   - Deploy a central Ollama server farm
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Enable comprehensive logging
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns
   - Retain logs according to your security policy

3. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Develop a plan for security incidents
   - Include procedures for model isolation if compromised

## Security FAQ

**Q: Can Llama Coder leak my code to the internet?**  
A: No. When properly configured, all processing happens locally or on your specified server.

**Q: Are there risks to using third-party models?**  
A: Yes. Only use models from trusted sources, as they could potentially contain harmful code.

**Q: Is it safe to use Llama Coder with proprietary code?**  
A: When deployed properly with the security measures outlined above, Llama Coder can be used with proprietary code while maintaining confidentiality.
